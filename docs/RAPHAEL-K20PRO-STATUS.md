# Status and roadmap

Tested on one Redmi K20 Pro (`raphael`, 6 GB, Global, firmware V12.5.2.0), November 2026.

HakiOS's main phone is the **POCO X5 Pro**. Its README lists these hardware drivers: display,
Goodix touch, UFS storage, Adreno 642L GPU, WCN6750 Wi-Fi, the audio DSP, the modem, Awinic
haptics and the cameras. The goal of this branch is to bring raphael up to the same level. This is where it
stands:

| Feature | POCO X5 Pro (main device) | raphael now | What it takes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display, scanout | yes | **yes** | done |
| Touch | yes | **yes** | done (Goodix GT9886) |
| Buttons (power, volume) | yes | **yes** | done |
| CPU, frequency scaling | yes | **yes** (7 of 8 cores; core 0 stays with the loader) | done |
| GPU (OpenGL ES) | yes (Adreno 642L) | **yes** (Adreno 640) | done; Metal is not available on either |
| Wi-Fi | yes (WCN6750) | **yes** (WCN3990, ath10k) | works; slow to find networks; no reconnect after toggling Wi-Fi (known upstream bug) |
| Battery level, charging state | yes | **yes** | read-only, via the firmware's Qualcomm charger drivers (commit `84647ba`) |
| Brightness control | not found in the repo | **yes** (panel's own brightness) | done: the slider's level is caught in `backboardd`, passed to the kernel (`kern.hakios.brightness`) and sent to the Samsung EA8076 as DCS `0x51` through the DSI controller. Boot arguments `brightness=1 brightness_dcs=1`. Auto-brightness and the ambient-light sensor are not supported |
| **Sound** | yes (DSP + Awinic amps) | **yes (loudspeaker)** | iOS's sound plays through the audio DSP, the NXP TFA9874 amplifier and the DSP's speaker protection: [RAPHAEL-K20PRO-SOUND.md](RAPHAEL-K20PRO-SOUND.md). Headphones and microphones need the SLIMbus codec (WCD9341), which is much harder |
| **Auto-brightness** | not found in the repo | **no** | needs the ambient light sensor. It is not on a bus the main processor can read; sensors on Qualcomm phones sit behind a DSP. No `slpi` firmware is in the modem image (it may run on the audio DSP instead), so this waits until the audio DSP is up. iOS's own auto-brightness needs calibration data, so a simple curve of our own, feeding the same brightness path, is the realistic plan |
| **Bluetooth** | not enabled | **no** | WCN3990 over UART; the open problem is iOS's Bluetooth stack, which no HakiOS port provides |
| Storage (keep data between boots) | yes (UFS) | **no** | storage driver for raphael |
| Haptics, torch | yes | **no** | raphael's vibration motor and flash drivers |
| Cellular | yes | **no** | modem bring-up (the NV partitions pulled in step 3 are already the first ingredient) |
| Cameras | yes | **no** | camera sensor and ISP drivers |

## Order of work

1. ~~Speaker-only sound~~ (done).
2. Haptics and torch.
3. Storage persistence.
4. Cellular, then cameras.

Bluetooth stays a research item until someone has an approach for iOS's side.

## Why one firmware version

The UEFI is built from drivers extracted from your phone's own XBL, plus a few single-byte patches
in three modules (`DALSYSDxe`, `UsbConfigDxe`, `ButtonsDxe`). On V12.5.2.0 those three modules are
byte-identical to the originals the upstream author patched, so the patches apply, even though the
XBL image as a whole differs. Another firmware version needs `devices/raphael/kit/check-xbl.py` to say so first. The published upstream UEFI image embeds the *author's* XBL
and black-screens on a phone whose XBL differs, which is the main reason this branch exists.
